Usage
=====

OpenSCM defines and provides three interfaces for its users.

Its **main** interface is targeted to users who want to include
OpenSCM in their model, e.g. integrated assessment modellers. This
interface provides the basic functionality necessary to run all SCMs
included in OpenSCM. It includes functions for getting and setting
parameters as well as to run and reset the model. Additionally, it
allows for reading and writing parameters from and to standardized and
other file formats, including whole scenario definitions.

The **ensemble** interface provides functions for running ensembles of
model runs.

The **ScmDataFrame** provides a high-level model output analysis tool.
It is designed to make model output filtering, plotting and writing
to/from disk as easy as possible. In addition, it integrates with the
tools provided by the pyam <https://github.com/IAMconsortium/pyam>_
package which facilitates easy inclusion of data from integrated
assessment modelling exercises too. Interested users should note that the
**ScmDataFrame** is maintainted in a separate project at
<https://github.com/lewisjared/scmdata>_.
